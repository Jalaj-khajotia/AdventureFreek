            <h2>Our journey started</h2>

            <p>I packed my luggage and was overwhelmed s going for an adventurous trek and was feeling exciting. I reached there in evening and saw the pretty view of mountains which was fully covered with ice due to heavy quantity of rainfall, and this trek is named as Zanskar hike. This area is well known for recording the lowest temperature and surely it will make stirring treks in Ladakh and exhilarating for every trekker. This region is located in Ladakh region and Buddhism culture is famous all around the world. Trek in Chadar Frozen Lake was auspicious and unique the lovely landscape and atmosphere, the frozen stream, sled ever varying Chadar. The luscious view of Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake was very dreamy and catchy. This Chadar trek isolated my mind and I was feeling very cold as the weather was very freezy and Zanskar River in midst of winter was catching a glimpse of preetiness. The pious exquisiteness of the nature, amazing mountains, conspicuous valleys, forest was making a incredible view. Ladakh venture tourism is praised because of its magnificent enrichment of rare penguin species and eye-catching mountains, grassy forests. Trekking in Ladakh was adding grace and fantasy when I started for the lovely track. There were gigantic dell and frozen lakes everywhere I can see snow which was hitting the highest point and looked very mesmerizing</p>
